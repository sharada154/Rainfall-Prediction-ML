# Rainfall-Prediction-ML
We built a system that predicts whether it will rain using weather data such as pressure, humidity, sunshine, and wind direction. Traditional forecasts are often slow and less accurate, so we used machine learning to create a fast, automatic, and more reliable solution â€” especially helpful for agriculture and daily planning.

**Objective:**  
To develop a predictive model that can accurately forecast the **occurrence** of rainfall using historical meteorological data with machine learning techniques.
